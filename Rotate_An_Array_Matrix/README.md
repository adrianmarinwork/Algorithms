Write a `rotate` function that rotates a two-dimensional array (a matrix) either clockwise or anti-clockwise by 90 degrees, and returns the rotated array.

The function accepts two parameters: an array, and a string specifying the direction or rotation. The direction will be either `"clockwise"` or `"counter-clockwise"`.

Here is an example of how your function will be used:

```
var matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]];

rotate(matrix, "clockwise"); // Would return  [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2],  [9, 6, 3]]
```

To help you visualize the rotated matrix, here it is formatted as a grid:

```
 [[7, 4, 1],
  [8, 5, 2],
  [9, 6, 3]]
```

Rotated counter-clockwise it would looks like this:

```
 [[3, 6, 9],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [1, 4, 7]]
```
